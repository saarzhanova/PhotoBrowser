# PhotoBrowser

This project provides an interactive photo annotation tool designed to overlay and edit annotations on images. Users can toggle annotations on top of photos, select individual annotations, and move them as needed. The tool also supports color customization for selected annotations, using a built-in color picker, making it ideal for tasks that require flexible image labeling and annotation.

## Usage
- **Toggle Annotations**: Double-click to toggle annotations on or off over the photo.
- **Select an Annotation**: Click on an annotation to select it. Clicking on another annotation will change the selection, while clicking on the background will deselect.
- **Move Annotations**: Once an annotation is selected, drag it to the desired position.
- **Change Color**: Use the color picker in the toolbar to adjust the color of the selected annotation.
