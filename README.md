# PhotoBrowser

This project provides an interactive photo annotation tool designed to overlay and edit annotations on images. Users can toggle annotations on top of photos, select individual annotations, and move them as needed. The tool also supports color customization for selected annotations, using a built-in color picker, making it ideal for tasks that require flexible image labeling and annotation.
